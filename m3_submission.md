    2. **Important**: The function that drives one of the challenges is `updateCurrentPage(str)` which takes 1 parameter, a string of the word to display as the current page. This function is not included in the code of the page, along with a few other things, are linked via an external js file. Make sure you do not delete this line.  
5. Create a branch called M3-Challenge-HW if you haven't yet
6. Add this template to that branch (git add/git commit)
7. Make a pull request for this branch once you push it
8. You may manually deploy the HW branch to dev to get the evidence for the below prompts
9. Create a new file **m3_submission.md** file in the hw branch and fill it with the output generated from this page (be careful not to paste more than once)
10. Add, commit, and push the submission file
11. Close the pull request by merging it to dev (double-check all looks good on dev)
12. Manually create a new pull request from dev to prod (i.e., base: prod <- compare: dev)
13. Complete the merge to deploy to production
14. Submit the direct link of the m3_submission.md from the prod branch to Canvas for this submission

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Briefly explain how you made the navigation horizontal</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>i used the display flex property to change the default stacked property of<br>the unordered list and change them into a vertical one<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Briefly explain how you remove the navigation list item markers</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>i used the style-type none to change the list to have no style,<br>getting rid of the unnecessary stylings<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> Briefly explain how you gave the navigation a background</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>i used the background color property to change the color initially to light<br>blue, then later in the assignment, it said to add some css styling<br>for points, so i changed it to a gradient fill<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 4: </em> Briefly explain how you made the links (or their surrounding area) change color on mouseover/hover</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>i used the hover css property to change the links change color on<br>hover<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 5: </em> Briefly explain how you changed the challenge list bullet points to checkmarks (âœ“)</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>first, i removed any and all styling from the list items as in<br>part 4, then i used the before property to allow me to add<br>pseudo elements before the actual list contents, from there i just added the<br>content &quot;right check mark&quot; and i also created a separate property for it<br>since the assignment exp[licitly told us that the navigation bar should not have<br>the styling that is applied to the next .<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 6: </em> Briefly explain how you made the first character of the h1 tags and anchor tags uppercased</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>i used the capitalize method to do the following, previously i used the<br>uppercase method to change it, but it made all letters caps, so i<br>searched around the internet and turns out, there is a conveniently created capitalize<br>method... so, i used it!<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 7: </em> Briefly explain/describe your custom styling of your choice</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>i added a box shadow to the nav bar elements that appears on<br>the hover of the mouse cursor, i also changed the solid color of<br>the nav bar into a beautiful gradient of teal and green, the box<br>shadow appears to the right of the nav bar elements and haas a<br>smooth ease-in transition applied to them, i could have turned this ugly page<br>into a really good looking glassmorphic page, but the comments at the bottom<br>of the assignment prevented me to do so since it said that if<br>any changes were made to that section, i would loose points, which really<br>pains me.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 8: </em> Briefly explain how the styling for the challenge list doesn't impact the navigation list</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>the styling for the challenge list doesnot effect the nav bar because i<br>used different styling properties for both of them, i styled the nav bar<br>into a different section, and did the challenge list in another section, it<br>is similar to styling different divs, but not quite, since they are not<br>placed in a div. I also commented what i did in my code<br>to make it easier for the instructor to understand my process.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 9: </em> Briefly explain how you updated the content of the h1 tag with the link text</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>This was by far the hardest task because i had to learn some<br>new javascript functions like event listener and how to use the query selector,<br>at first, i was only using the queryselector by itself, which somewhat worked,<br>but only worked for the login link, the other links in the navbar<br>did not really affect the title and the header of the page, but<br>then i found out, that it was because the query selector only selects<br>the first element, but again, it did not work.. what was the issue?<br>my query selector was not able to iterate thru the links in the<br>nav bar, the solution? a simple for each loop.&nbsp; And, then from there,<br>i used the query selector in a for loop to select each item<br>and then update the header and the title.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 10: </em> Briefly explain how you updated the content of the title tag with the link text</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I updated the h1 and the title tag using a single piece of<br>code and that process is described in the answer to question 9. Note<br>- i did not use the functions and other things that were mentioned<br>in the assignment that was there to help us, because it was too<br>confusing for me to understand, what i did was learn some basic javascript<br>function and read thru the docs to find out a method to achieve<br>the same result but in a different approach. Also, my process is much<br>easier.<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>i learned how to make a horizontal nav bar, remove styling, add custom<br>styling, different hover effects and properties of css. Also i had to learn<br>some basic javascript syntax and read thru the official javascript docs to figure<br>out an easier way to achieve a complicated task, on which, i am<br>really proud of myself.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
